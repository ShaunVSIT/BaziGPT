# Architecture Refactor: SPA to Multi-Page App
**Date:** 2024-06-22

---

## Key Architectural Changes

- **Centralized Routing & Code Splitting**
  - Migrated from a classic SPA structure to a modular, multi-page React app using React Router.
  - All routes are now defined in `src/routes/index.tsx` for easy management and scalability.
  - Each page (Home, Daily, About, Privacy, Terms, etc.) is a true React page component, loaded via React Router.
  - Implemented React’s `lazy()` and `Suspense` for code splitting—each page is loaded only when needed, improving performance.

- **Page Directory Structure**
  - All main pages are now in `src/pages/` (e.g., `Home.tsx`, `Daily.tsx`, `About.tsx`), each with its own SEO metadata and logic.
  - Reusable UI components remain in `src/components/`.

- **SEO Improvements**
  - Each page sets its own `<title>` and meta tags using `react-helmet-async`.
  - Open Graph and Twitter Card support for each page.
  - Better support for search engine indexing and social sharing.

- **Unified Layout & Footer**
  - All pages are wrapped in a single `Layout` component, ensuring consistent navigation and footer across the app.
  - Footer and navigation are no longer duplicated or scattered.

- **Navigation Scalability**
  - Navigation is now data-driven and easily extensible—add a new page by updating the navigation config and routes.
  - Navigation is responsive and adapts to both desktop and mobile.

- **Error Handling**
  - Added a global `ErrorBoundary` to catch React rendering errors.
  - Graceful fallbacks for failed page/component loads.

- **Testing & Maintainability**
  - Modularized codebase makes it easier to test and maintain individual features.
  - Test files and scripts are now organized by type and location.

## Manual Testing Recommendations for Multi-Page Architecture

- Test direct navigation to all routes (e.g., `/`, `/daily`, `/about`, `/privacy`, `/terms`) via browser address bar.
- Verify that each page loads only its own content and metadata.
- Check browser history and back/forward navigation.
- Confirm that navigation and footer are consistent across all pages.
- Test SEO tags and social sharing previews for each page.
- Ensure error boundaries catch and display errors gracefully.

# BaziGPT Refactor & Change Log
**Date:** 2024-06-22

---

## Navigation & Layout
- Replaced old navigation with a new `CompactNavigation` component:
  - **Desktop:** Navigation items are now centered, with the BaziGPT logo/title removed from the left.
  - **Mobile:** Hamburger menu and logo remain for brand recognition.
  - Navigation bar is now more vertically compact (reduced height and padding).
  - Navigation is now consistent and scalable for future pages.
- Removed all in-page navigation bars from individual components (`SoloReading`, `CompatibilityReading`, `Daily`, `About`).
- Navigation is now handled globally in the `Layout` component.

---

## Footer
- Unified all footer content into a single `Footer` component:
  - Social links, legal links, and developer info are now in one place.
  - Social icons are larger and have a circular background on mobile for better tap targets.
  - Privacy and Terms are now styled as clear, accessible buttons (outlined, bold, compact).
  - On mobile, Privacy and Terms are side by side for space efficiency.
  - Removed the old `SocialFooter` component and all references.

---

## About Page
- Added a new “Types of Readings We Offer” section:
  - Explains Solo Reading, Compatibility Reading, and Daily Forecast with icons and descriptions.
  - Added clear CTA buttons for each reading type.
  - CTA buttons are now visually aligned and compact on desktop and mobile.
  - “Try Compatibility Reading” button now deep-links to compatibility mode using `/?mode=compatibility`.
- Added/clarified “What is Bazi?” section and general About content.

---

## Reading Pages (Solo & Compatibility)
- Reading card and form are now visually separated with a Paper card background.
- Mode toggle is now inside the card for a cohesive look.
- Reduced vertical spacing and padding for a more compact, above-the-fold layout.
- Footer is now visible on most desktop/laptop screens without scrolling.

---

## Test Organization & Cleanup
- Moved all test and debug scripts into a dedicated `tests/` directory, organized by `ui/`, `api/`, `analytics/`, and `debug/`.
- Updated all npm scripts in `package.json` to use new test file locations.
- Added a `tests/README.md` to document the test structure and available scripts.
- Removed obsolete test files and the old `SocialFooter` component.

---

## API Review
- Reviewed `api/daily-share-card.ts` for breaking changes:
  - API is robust and always returns a valid SVG, even on error.
  - Portrait/landscape detection is server-safe (always landscape on server).
  - No breaking changes detected; API remains reliable for share card generation.

---

## Manual Testing Notes
- **Navigation:**
  - Test navigation on both desktop and mobile (centered, hamburger menu, active states).
  - Add/remove pages and verify scalability.
- **Footer:**
  - Test social icon tap targets on mobile.
  - Test Privacy/Terms buttons for accessibility and correct routing.
- **About Page:**
  - Test CTA buttons for correct deep-linking and mode switching.
- **Reading Pages:**
  - Test mode toggle, form, and card layout for compactness and clarity.
  - Ensure footer is visible without scrolling on common screen sizes.
- **API:**
  - Test `/api/daily-share-card` for SVG output and error fallback.
- **General:**
  - Check for any missing or broken links, navigation, or UI regressions.

**Summary:**
This refactor modernizes navigation, unifies the footer, improves mobile and desktop UX, clarifies the About page, and organizes tests for maintainability. Manual testing is recommended to verify all flows and ensure no breaking changes were introduced.
